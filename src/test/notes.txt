ok so 

what we can do 

we need to interface with what bets exist 

so we can have a factory contract 

that spawns children contracts that serve as "pairs"

kind of like how the factory uniswap contracts spawns contracts dedicated to pairs 

the factory can spawn contracts dedicated to pairs of betters AND the token that they are betting on

    V
    0xA... vs. 0xB... Bet contract 
        ETH/DAI bet 
        0xA long, B short 
            0xA wins if ETH > $3000
            0xB wins if ETH <= $3000
        from this, we need to be able to calculate the price of the ETH/(DAI/USDT/USDC) pair 
            - spot price is susceptible to price manipulation, no good
            - we can calculate the twap and allow bets within some interval 
            - for now, we will just calculate the spot price and adjust our code as needed 
        no point in calculating the price off chain, i want an interopable betting protocol
