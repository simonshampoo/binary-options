ok so 

what we can do 

we need to interface with what bets exist 

so we can have a factory contract 

that spawns children contracts that serve as "pairs"

kind of like how the factory uniswap contracts spawns contracts dedicated to pairs 

the factory can spawn contracts dedicated to pairs of betters AND the token that they are betting on
